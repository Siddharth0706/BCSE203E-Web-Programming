                    <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
                    <p>The simple game of tic-tac-toe is a two-player game of Xs and Os. Play
                        begins with nine spaces on a paper created by crossing two perpendicular sets
                        of two parallel lines. One player begins (take turns being the first player) by
                        placing an X in one square. The next player draws an O in another square.
                        The game continues until there are three Xs or Os in a row or all squares are
                        filled–a draw game, also called cat’s.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Dots and Boxes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Remember the time it took to form an array of dots across the page? To play
                        Dots, you need a square of dots on the page (start with 6×6 and challenge
                        your kids to go up to 30×30 or more). Once the square is created, players (2
                        or more) take turns with a different color pen creating line segments between
                        dots. When a player forms a square with their line, they may put their initial
                        in that square and play again. The game continues until all the lines between
                        the dots have been drawn.

                        <li>1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
                        <li>2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
                        <li>3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
                        <li>4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
